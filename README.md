# Website-UI
This repository contains the HTML and CSS code for a webpage showcasing featured events at MIT, created as part of an assignment. The webpage is designed with a responsive layout and incorporates various visual elements to enhance the user experience.

The featured events section is styled with a centered alignment, a border at the bottom, and a title that is underlined, bold, and displayed in a maroon color. The events are organized using a flexbox layout with columns, providing a balanced and aesthetically pleasing presentation. Each event column includes the date, event title, and location.

To improve readability, the events are styled with appropriate font sizes and colors, ensuring a clear visual hierarchy. The "See All Events" button stands out with its red background color, white text color, and a subtle box shadow, drawing attention to the option of exploring additional events.

The webpage also features grey divider lines for visual separation, enhancing the overall structure and readability of the content.

This project offers potential for further development and customization. You can modify the code to add more events, incorporate dynamic data, or extend the functionality to include event details, registration forms, or interactive features. Feel free to explore and build upon this codebase to suit your specific requirements.

Note: Make sure to include the link to the CSS file in the HTML code for proper styling.
